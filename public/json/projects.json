Its aim is to help the co-creation in company meetings, using for example a collaborative dashboard where all users can participate at once. \n\nOur task at Hetic was to make some research & development around the theme of this start-up. With our team, we came up with 2 little apps : the first one allows a pool of user to participate to the creation of \"posts-it\" with their smartphones, and all of them were displayed to a \"server\" machine. \nThe second one uses the posts-it of the first one to create quick Bootstrap-based mockups. \n\nTechnologies :\n- NodeJS \n- Socket.io \n- AngularJS \n- JQuery UI",
